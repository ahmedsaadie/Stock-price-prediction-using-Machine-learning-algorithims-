# Stock-price-prediction-using-Machine-learning-algorithims-
 
Problem Description:
        	The Efficient Market Hypothesis is an investment theory that states the stock market is unpredictable and cannot be anticipated. However, investment banks and financial firms have become multibillion-dollar behemoths by making such market predictions. The act of predicting stock prices by using historical data is called Technical Analysis. Financial firms employ Quantitative Traders who conduct rigorous Technical Analyses to make educated bets in the stock market. These traders utilize sophisticated machine learning models and combine it with their understanding of the market to generate steady profit streams for their businesses.
In this project, we use a simple algorithm to perform our own Technical Analyses and apply it as an investment strategy. The goal of this project is to utilize different machine learning models and try to predict the daily movement of stock using the most accurate model.
This problem is being solved already by financial firms and if someone is betting without using such tools, they are undertaking a huge risk. Stock market prediction only rewards those who are the quickest to react and investors that jump in later reap much fewer profits.
 

 
Solution Summary
        	In essence, the objective of this project is to predict the next day’s stock movement (up or down) given past data. For instance, if we can predict with great accuracy that tomorrow’s price of a particular stock will go up. Then, we can buy that stock today and sell it tomorrow to make a profit on that upwards movement. However, there is a cost per transaction and thus the gain must be enough to cover the cost of trading and have profit left over.
